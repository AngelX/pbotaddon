Client addon for Blueboy's Playerbot for Mangos


to install, copy the PlayerbotUI directory to your wow installation as follows



..\wow installation\interface\addons\*PlayerbotUI goes here*

Don't change the name of the PlayerbotUI directory.

Start your client and at the character screen click on addons and ensure that PlayerbotUI is checked.

Start the game.

You should summon your bots before using the menu.

bot summoning from the menu isnt implemented at this time.

After summoning your bots AND /inviting them, 
type /pbm OR /pbotmenu

the menu will appear, click on main for switches, orders to set combat orders.

Crafting is in the works (it might take me a bit)

Its not much, but its a start....

Let me know if you have any problems / suggestions
